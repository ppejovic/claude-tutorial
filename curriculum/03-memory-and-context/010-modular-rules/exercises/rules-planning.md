# Rules Planning Exercise

Plan out the .claude/rules/ structure for a project. Think about what rules apply to which files.

## Your Project: ___

### Rule Files Needed

| Rule File | Path Pattern | Key Rules |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| ___.md | `___` | ___ |
| ___.md | `___` | ___ |
| ___.md | `___` | ___ |
| ___.md | `___` | ___ |

### Questions to Consider
1. Which conventions apply to ALL files? (These go in CLAUDE.md, not rules/)
2. Which conventions are path-specific? (These go in rules/ with `paths:` frontmatter)
3. Are any rules unconditional but topic-specific? (These go in rules/ without `paths:`)
4. Would subdirectories help organize your rules? (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)
