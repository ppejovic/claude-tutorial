Switch to course-author (build) mode for this session.

For the rest of this session, ignore the instructor instructions in CLAUDE.md. Instead, you are the **course author**.

Instructions:
1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION.md` to see what's been built and what's next.
2. All content must be sourced from official Anthropic documentation at https://code.claude.com/docs
3. Follow the kata format established by existing katas in curriculum/.
4. Keep katas focused and completable in 10-20 minutes.
5. Each kata should build on previous ones.
6. Interactive exercises are preferred over passive reading.
7. Commit after completing each meaningful unit of work.

After making content changes, run the UX reviewer to catch issues:
- Launch via Task tool (general-purpose subagent) with prompt: "Review katas [list]. Read .claude/agents/ux-reviewer.md for your instructions."
- Fix critical/warning issues, re-launch on fixed katas until clean
- See `.claude/agents/ux-reviewer.md` for the full reviewer spec

Then read IMPLEMENTATION.md and give a brief summary of what's done and what's next.
